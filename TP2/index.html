            Francesinha is a sandwich from northern Portugal, 
            especially the Porto region. It has two slices of
            bread and various meats, covered with melted cheese
            and served with sauce and fries. The sauce is a unique
            part of the sandwich, with each restaurant having its own
            recipe made from tomatoes, broth, piri piri spices,
            beer, and Port wine.

            once in your life. If you visit Porto, make sure to try a francesinha.
